From our start in 2003 as a handful of committed individuals covering local Connecticut sports, our publication has grown – and continues to grow — steadily to a staff of well over 100 writers and photographers nationwide, covering amateur, high school, college and professional sports.

If you are a sports fan, you have come to the right place! MYsports.com was founded by people just like you — sports fanatics. Our website is updated around the clock as information breaks, often in the form of press releases from every major professional sports league in India.

All of this complements the scores of original and feature events handled by our own staff members each week along with the comprehensive photo coverage MYsports.com has become known for nationwide.
